## About the GW Regulatory Studies Center

The GW Regulatory Studies Center's mission is to improve regulatory policy through research, education and outreach. The Center is a leading source for applied scholarship in regulatory issues, and a training ground for anyone who wants to understand the effects of regulation and ensure that regulatory policies are designed in the public interest.

Established in 2009, the GW RSC is an academic center of the George Washington University, a private, top-tier university located in the Nation’s capital. It is housed within the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration, which is consistently ranked among the nation’s top policy schools, and attracts high-achieving students interested in careers in public policy. In addition, with our location near the White House and Capitol Hill, the GW RSC is a hub for academic institutions around the country, and brings fresh ideas and analysis to policy makers in Washington.
